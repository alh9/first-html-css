					The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
					It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by 
					nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light 
					and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
					Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth.
					Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and accounts for about 99.86% of 
					the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of
					hydrogen ; the rest is mostly helium , with much smaller quantities of heavier elements,
					including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

					The Moon is Earth's only proper natural satellite.
					It is one quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia)
					making it the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet.
					It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and is larger than any dwarf planet.
					The Moon orbits Earth at an average lunar distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),
					or 1.28 light-seconds. Its gravitational influence produces Earth's tides and slightly
					lengthens Earth's day. It is considered a planetary-mass moon and a differentiated rocky body.

					Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt,
					a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper
					belt object to be discovered. After Pluto was discovered in 1930 it was declared to be 
					the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning in the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned 
					following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt, including the
					dwarf planet Eris. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally 
					define the term "planet" — excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.

					Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
					About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71%
					is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers and other fresh water, 
					which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.
					Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the 
					surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core,
					a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that
					drives plate tectonics.

					Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
					It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half
					times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one 
					of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky and has been known
					to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god
					Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light
					to cast visible shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the 
					night sky after the Moon and Venus.

					Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System,
					after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.
					It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, 
					Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god
					of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.
					The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day")
					no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn .

					Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun.
					In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, 
					the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
					It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
					Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because 
					its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
					The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years 
					at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km;
					2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆,
					a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

					Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System,
					being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war 
					and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of 
					the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive 
					among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with
					a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and
					the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

					Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
					As the second-brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, 
					Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
					 Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, 
					either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn.
					Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, 
					it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System by far, 
					and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west
					and sets in the east).

					Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky,
					Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and 
					father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest
					planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune,
					and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants 
					Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as
					"ice giants" to distinguish them from the other gas giants.

					Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the sun in the Solar System.
					Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the
					Solar System. It is named after the Greek god Hermes (Ερμής), translated into Latin as 
					Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, mediator between gods and mortals.
					Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet,
					and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
					This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after 
					sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
